# THM Advent of Cyber 2025
In December 2025, I participated in TryHackMe's Advent of Cyber 2025 event. This repo serves as my overview of the cybersecurity tools and techniques learned in the event. This <b> DOES NOT </b> reveal any of the story or answers to room questions. Rather, it outlines the various cybersecurity concepts learned through the rooms.


<h2>Applications Used</h2>

- Linux CLI
- Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET)
- Splunk Enterprise
- 

<h2>Platforms Used</h2>

- [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/adventofcyber25)
- Linux
- Windows



<h2>Rooms</h2>
<h3>Linux CLI - Shells Bells (Day 1)</h3>

Day 1 explores the Linux Command-line Interface (CLI) from a beginner-level standpoint. TryHackMe provides a short view course explaining the basics of Linux terminal and how it can be more used more productively than a graphical interphase (GUI). Participants will be exposed to a browser-based Ubuntu virtual machine and basic Linux commands that will help guide them through later advent rooms. Day 1 also provides an optional side quest for more advanced cybersecurity professionals to access within the Linux terminal.

<h4>Commands Used:</h4>

- echo
- ls
- cat
- pwd
- cd
- grep
- find
- rm
- mv
- uptime
- ip addr
- ps aux
- sudo su
- whoami
- history

<h4>Tools Used:</h4>

- Ubuntu virtual machine
- Linux command-line terminal

<h3>Phishing - Merry Clickmas (Day 2)</h3>

In Day 2, participants learn about social engineering and the different types of phishing. The room provides an overview about how red teams create fake login pages and phishing campaigns to perform security awareness trainings. Participants are given the opportunity to create their own phishing campaign from a fake login portal created by the TryHackMe team.

<h4>Concepts Explored:</h4>

- Social Engineering
- Phishing

<h4>Tools Used:</h4>

- Ubuntu virtual machine
- Linux CLI
- Social-Engineer Toolkit (SET)

<h3>Splunk Basics - Did you SIEM? (Day 3)</h3>

Day 3 exposes participants to SIEM solutions and how SOC teams use solutions such as Splunk to ingest and interpret log data. Particiants will read a scanario from a fictional SOC team and analyze the Splunk logs of the web traffic and firewall logs of a fake compromised web server.

<h4>Concepts Explored:</h4>

- Log Analysis
- Anomaly Detection

<h4>Tools Used:</h4>

- Splunk Enterprise
